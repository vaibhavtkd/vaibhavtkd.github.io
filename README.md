## How to personalize
1. Open `assets/js/main.js` and update the `PROFILE` object (name, email, phone, GitHub/LinkedIn/Kaggle/Twitter).
2. Replace images in `assets/img/` with your own (keep the same filenames or update paths in `index.html`).
3. Drop your CV as `assets/docs/resume.pdf` so the **Resume** buttons work.
4. Update project card titles, descriptions, and links in `index.html` (search for `Projects` section).

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser. Everything uses CDNs, so no build step is required.

## Deploy
- GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages (root or `/docs`).
- Netlify/Vercel: drag-and-drop the folder or connect the repo.

Enjoy!
